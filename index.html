    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hey everyone! My name is Gotham. A fun fact about me is that I have
    lived in Texas practically my whole life. I'm originally from Amarillo 
    (way up north), and that's basically where I spent my childhood. Then we 
    moved to Plano/Frisco, which was really different from the rural scenary. 
    And then I went to college in Austin, which was way different than the other
    two. Out of these three, I would have to say that Austin is my favorite 
    city. There's always something to do there.</p>

    <p>Some of my hobbies are:</p>
<ul>
  
  <li>Going on runs</li>
  <li>Watching netflix</li>
  <li>Spend hours on Twitter</li>
  <li>Finding ways to annoy my dog</li>
  <li>Watching Gordon Ramsey cooking videos</li>
  
</ul>
